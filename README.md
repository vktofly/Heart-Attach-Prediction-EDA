# Heart-Attach-Prediction-EDA

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical and demographic factors.

## Dataset Overview
- **Dependent Variables:**
  - Age, Sex, Exercise-induced angina, Number of major vessels, Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Cholesterol levels, Fasting blood sugar, Resting electrocardiographic results, Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **Independent Variable:**
  - Target (0 = less chance, 1 = more chance of a heart attack).

## Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze variable distributions.
   - Identify correlations.
   - Visualize patterns and trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Split dataset (training/testing).
   - Implement machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
   - Train the model.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
   - Fine-tune parameters.

5. **Interpretation and Visualization:**
   - Interpret feature importance.
   - Visualize decision boundaries.

6. **Deployment (Optional):**
   - Optionally deploy for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion
Summarize findings, discuss model reliability, and propose applications for early heart attack risk detection.
